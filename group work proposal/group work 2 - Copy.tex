\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Theoratical backgroud of the study}
Agriculture continues to be the most important sector in Uganda's economy in terms of provision of employment despite of its declined contribution to  the nation's foreign exchange earnings .Poultry farming is the process of raising domesticated birds such as chickens ,ducks, turkeys and gees for the purpose of farming meat or eggs for food. Poultry are farmed in great numbers  with poultry being the  most numerous .More than 50 billion chicken are raised annually as a source of food for both their meat and their eggs .Chicken raised for meat are often called broilers while chicken raised for eggs are usually called  layers . Poultry production enterprises require good record keeping systems to ensure success.


\subsection{Introduction of the proposed system}
Poultry record keeping system is a database software system that can be used to record needed or relevant information pertaining a poultry farm. The system is needed because the importance associated with adequately monitoring the activities in a poultry farm. A detailed set of records is essential to making sound farm management decisions. Computer based record systems are widely available and should be considered when setting up a record system.
This document discusses the importance of farm records, explains the basics of book keeping and outlines other major record keeping components and concepts including asset inventory, depreciation profit and loss, enterprise counting and cash flow.
