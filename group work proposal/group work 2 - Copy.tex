\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Theoratical backgroud of the study}
Agriculture continues to be the most important sector in Uganda's economy in terms of provision of employment despite of its declined contribution to  the nation's foreign exchange earnings .Poultry farming is the process of raising domesticated birds such as chickens ,ducks, turkeys and gees for the purpose of farming meat or eggs for food. Poultry are farmed in great numbers  with poultry being the  most numerous .More than 50 billion chicken are raised annually as a source of food for both their meat and their eggs .Chicken raised for meat are often called broilers while chicken raised for eggs are usually called  layers . Poultry production enterprises require good record keeping systems to ensure success.


\subsection{Introduction of the proposed system}
Poultry record keeping system is a database software system that can be used to record needed or relevant information pertaining a poultry farm. The system is needed because the importance associated with adequately monitoring the activities in a poultry farm. A detailed set of records is essential to making sound farm management decisions. Computer based record systems are widely available and should be considered when setting up a record system.
This document discusses the importance of farm records, explains the basics of book keeping and outlines other major record keeping components and concepts including asset inventory, depreciation profit and loss, enterprise counting and cash flow. 





\subsection{Statement of the problem}
Difficulty in report generating where there is a need to perform more calculations to generate report of previous records and financial statements. A lot of paper work is being done in the existing system where loss of even a  single record leads to a difficult situation because all papers are needed to generate the report.

\subsection{Objectives}
\subsubsection{Main objectives}
The main aim of the study is to develop a poultry Record keeping system that will automate the manual means of recording poultry farm records.


\subsubsection{Specific objectives}
\begin{itemize}
\item To develop a database application that can be used to maintain and provide financial information aspect of the poultry farm.
\item To reduce on the time wasted in making reports about the profits and losses made on the poultry farm.
\item To provide a system that can facilitate the update of poultry farm records.
\item To develop a system that will aid the presentation of reports pertaining the poultry farm.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Scope}
This research work covers the design and implementation of the poultry record record keeping system. It is restricted to record information concerning the birds reared and the financial aspect of income and expenses of the poultry farm.
\subsection{Research Significance of the study}
The significance of the study is that it will provide useful information and means to enable the management of the poultry farm to automate their record keeping process for better updating and presentation of reports. It will also serve as a useful reference material to other researchers that need related information.
