\section{Theoretical background of the study}
Agriculture continues to be the most important sector in Uganda's economy
in terms of provision of employment despite of its declined contribution to the
nation's foreign exchange earnings .Poultry farming is the process of raising
domesticated birds such as chickens ,ducks, turkeys and gees for the purpose
of farming meet or eggs for food. Poultry are farmed in great numbers with
poultry being the most numerous .More than 50 billion chicken are raised
annually as a source of food for both their meet and their eggs .Chicken
raised for meet are often called broilers while chicken raised for eggs are
usually called layers . Poultry production enterprises require good record
keeping systems to ensure success.
\section{Introduction to the proposed system}
Poultry record keeping system is a database software system that can be
used to record needed or relevant information pertaining a poultry farm.
The system is needed because the importance associated with adequately
monitoring the activities in a poultry farm. A detailed set of records is
essential to making sound farm management decisions. Computer based
record systems are widely available and should be considered when setting
up a record system. This document discusses the importance of farm records,
explains the basics of book keeping and outlines other major record keeping
components and concepts including asset inventory, depreciation profit and
loss, enterprise counting and cash flow.
\section{Statement of the problem}
Difficulty in report generating where there is a need to perform more calculations to generate report of previous records and financial statements. A lot of paper work is being done in the existing system where loss of even a single record leads to a difficult situation because all papers are needed to generate
the report.
\section{ Objectives}
\subsection{ Main objectives}
The main aim of the study is to develop a poultry Record keeping system
that will automate the manual means of recording poultry farm records.
\subsection{Specific objectives}
\begin{itemize}
\item To develop a database application that can be used to maintain and
provide financial information aspect of the poultry farm.
\item To provide a system that can facilitate the update of poultry farm
records.
\item To develop a system that will aid the presentation of reports pertaining
the poultry farm.
\end{itemize}

\section{Scope}
This research work covers the design and implementation of the poultry
record record keeping system. It is restricted to record information concerning the birds reared and the financial aspect of income and expenses of
the poultry farm.
\section{Research Significance of the study}
The significance of the study is that it will provide useful information and means to enable the management of the poultry farm to automate their record keeping process for better updating and presentation of reports. It will also serve as a useful reference material to other researchers that need
related information.
\section{literature view}
Literature specifically relative to the degree Iowa farm operators 
keep and use farm business records or the record keeping procedures and practices used is limited.
The influence of high school vocational agriculture training upon 
production and management practices was investigated by Dakan (1) in 1956.the instrument included a section in the form of a check list which determined the different kinds of information kept in the farm records of the respondents in 1955. The purpose of this section was to determine the extent to which farm records were being kept.
Competencies in farm business analysis needed by males engaged in 
farming were investigated by Christy (2) in 1966. In comparing the methods of record keeping employed for the farm business, Christy(2) found that of the random sample of farmers, 53 percent used a farm account record book, 22 percent used only a file of receipts and cancelled checks, and 25 percent employed a combination of both methods. 
Donhowe (12) studied certain economic principles involved in farm and home development.  Budgets for the farm and home can assist the families in appraising the adequacy and use of their resources in achieving their goals . The summary of the farm and home record together with its analysis provides an even more effective tool because of the image it reflects of the farm and home business. An examination of the net worth statement kept by the family can also measure the adequacy of resources used and the progress made in becoming established in farming. 
\section{methodology}
\subsection{Description of the sample Population}
The population sampled in this study included candy poultry farm located in wakiso district , whose farm operations had gross sales of agricultural products totalling 2,500 us dollars or more. Inaddition to these geographical and income restrictions, an individual must have met the following criteria in order to have been classified as a
"farm operator":
\begin{enumerate}
\item  Must have received his remuneration from profits (or losses) of
the farm business.
\item Must have made decisions in the operation and management of the
farm.
\subsection{Development of poultry record keeping system} 
The purpose of the questionnaire, or interview schedule, was to obtain, as accurately and completely as possible, pertinent information related to the type of farm records kept by candy poultry farm.
and the extent to which these records were utilized for analysis purposes. 
\subsection{Data Collection Procedures}
The method of data collection was by personal interview. A Detailed instructions were given on field procedures, the questionnaire was intensively studied.A questionnaire was to be completed for each farm operator identified. 
\subsection{sample design}
The “POULTRY RECORD KEEPING APP “ is an Android based application software which is to be used in the poultry farming. This is particularly aimed systematically to carry out the entire activities performed in the farm. As every system has curtained limitation, this system has too but it is  almost well enough in the specification system.In this software there is less paper work and reports can easily be generated .
