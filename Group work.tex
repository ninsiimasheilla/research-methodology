Deployment of automated sprinklers to reduce the impacts of drought in karamonja, uganda

\pagenumbering{arabic}

\section{Problem statement}
The main purpose of this study was to determine the effects of drought in the areas of karamoja and the methods that can be used to reduce drought.
\section{Significance of the study}
The purpose of this study is to identify the effects of drought to people and emphasize the automated sprinkler system that will improve on their environment. 
	The purpose of the study is to provide an in-depth understanding of the range of environmental and social economic impacts triggered by past drought hazards in different contexts of karamoja.
\section{Main objectives}
The purpose of this study is to identify the effects of drought to people and emphasize the automated sprinkler system that will improve on their environment.
\subsection{Specific objectives}
1.To develop and test an innovative suit of drought indicators that integrate physical impact and vulnerability indices, which will address different spatio-temporal scales and water related sectors.
3.to foster a better understanding of past droughts and in particular to investigate driving factors and characteristics of the most extreme historic events in the contents of karamoja which will be validated against observed natural hazards.
\section{Methods of study}
Source of data was collected using observation and survey. we found out that several elderly persons and children have been reportedly starved to death in Moroto and Napac districts.
